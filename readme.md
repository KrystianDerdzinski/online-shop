- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the online shop.
- `products.json`: A JSON file that contains the product data.
- `images/`: A directory containing product images.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application. Using Liveserver extension is highly recommended for a great dev experience.
3. Modify the code in `style.css` and `script.js` to customize the application.
